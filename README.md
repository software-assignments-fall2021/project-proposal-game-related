# Project Proposal
2D RPG Game

### What and why?
As a potential game design student, I want to explore the possibilities I can do with game design through software engineering. I am not quite sure about what the game should look like, but I hope there will be people joining me to refine the details and develop a great RPG game together.

### For whom?
All game players that are interested in the game.

### How?
The system needs a great visual interface on the user's side, which allows the user to control character in the game to move around in a limited space and make decisions to proceed the game. Also, the users' information and game data need to be stored in a database.

### Scope
This project mainly focus on the frontside development, the realization of game mechanics, and a well-developed database. The workload mainly depends on the game mechanics, I think we can find a way to modulate the workload to be suitable for this course.
